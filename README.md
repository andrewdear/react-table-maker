it is a simple table generator that gives you the power to generate heads and rows with custom classes and data easily.

### Currently it supports

column data generation,
header styling,
td styling,
column sorting,

you can find a simple example on the repo under example https://github.com/andrewdear/react-table-maker/blob/master/example/src/App.js

### Next up in development

After sort functions
Custom pagination
sticky headers
custom row generator

### other todos

Current development issue https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991

find a way to test in development without having to add in react and react-dom as depends
or a way to run the app when included as a @file with these included.

Look at importing the types and exporting them from index to get auto complete to work, or find out why it isn't working in normal js.
